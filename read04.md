2- can write the code script in body inside script tag like this 

    <script>
    var firstname= prompt ("what is your first name ? ");

    var lastname= prompt ("what is your last name ?");

     alert ("welcome" +" " + firstname + " " + lastname+" 
     "+ ' and thank you for visit my page ');
