# How Forms Work 
1-A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server. <br>
2-The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.<br>
3-The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a database.<br>
4- The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received <br>

## Form Structure

<`form>`<br>
Form controls live inside a `<form>` element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.<br>
`<action>`<br>
Every `<form>` element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.<br>

## Text Input

`<input>`<br>
The `<input>` element is used to create several different form controls. The value of the type attribute determines what kind of input they will be creating.<br>
type="text"<br>
When the type attribute has a value of text, it creates a singleline text input. <br>

## Password Input 

`<input>`<br>
type="password"<br>
When the type attribute has a value of password it creates a text box that acts just like a single-line text input<br>
