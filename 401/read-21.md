### Does a deployed React application require a server? 
no 
### Why do we prefer to test a React application at the behavior rather than the unit level?
When it comes to React components you want to check how your component is rendered and if all props you pass to the component influence the behavior of your component as expected.
### What does npm run build do?
runs the build field from the package.json scripts field <br>
 creates a build directory with a production build of your app.
### Describe the actual composition / architecture of a React application

React application is split into components, it is important that you can add functionality to a component without causing rippling changes through the codebase


## Terms 

1- BDD :Behavior driven development, a branch of Test Driven Development (TDD), which uses human-readable descriptions of software user requirements as the basis for software tests.

2- mounting : is the phase in which our React component mounts on the DOM (i.e., is created and inserted into the DOM). This method is called just before a component mounts on the DOM or the render method is called. After this method, the component gets mounted

3-Acceptance Tests: Acceptance testing is a term used in agile software development methodologies, particularly extreme programming, referring to the functional testing of a user story by the software development team during the implementation phase.

4-build: React apps are built. Writing a react app is called building.
