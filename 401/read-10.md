## OAuth 

## OAuth :
 is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that provides applications the ability for “secure designated access.” For example, you can tell Facebook that it’s OK for ESPN.com to access your profile or post updates to your timeline without having to give ESPN your Facebook password. This minimizes risk in a major way: In the event ESPN suffers a breach, your Facebook password remains safe.

  OAuth stands for “Open Authorization”, is a technological standard that allows you to share information between services without exposing your password. 

   is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.This mechanism is used by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter to permit the users to share information about their accounts with third party applications or websites.

## OAuth 2 implementation
 

 Authorization Endpoint. The main role of the authorization endpoint is to first authenticate the user and then ask for the permissions – or scopes – that the application wants. As instructed by the OAuth2 specs, this endpoint should support the HTTP GET method, although it can also support the HTTP POST method

##  Authorization Code?
 An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space. 

 Password : for logging in with a username and password (only for first-party apps).

 Client credentials : grant type is used by clients to obtain an access token outside of the context of a user. This is typically used by clients to access resources about themselves rather than to access a user's resources

 Implicit : was a simplified OAuth flow previously recommended for native apps and JavaScript apps where the access token was returned immediately without an extra authorization code exchange step.
