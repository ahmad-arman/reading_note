## Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle 

The request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app. Understanding the request/response cycle is helpful to figure out which files to edit when developing an app (and where to look when things aren't working).


## Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

server is a computer program or device that provides a service to another computer program and its user, also known as the client. In a data center, the physical computer that a server program runs on is also frequently referred to as a server.
## What does it mean to “deploy” an application?


Deploying your application means putting it on a Web server so that it can be used either through the Internet or an intranet.



# Term
* Server : a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". ... Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.
* Pub/Sub : an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that produce events from services that process events.


* WRRC : The web is a cycle of requests and responses that flow between clients and servers. Any computer making a request is a client and any computer sending a response is a server.


# a virtual machine 
is the virtualization/emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination


## Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)
 is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

## AWS Elastic Beanstalk  
is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

You can simply upload your code and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application and can access the underlying resources at any time.
