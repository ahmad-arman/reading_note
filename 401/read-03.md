3-Response Object  :  it is represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.

 

4-Routing Middleware:  it that plays a role in path routing.

5-Test-driven development is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.

6-Behavioral Testing:  is a testing of the external behaviour of the program, also known as black box testing. It is usually a functional testing.ram.
