## Stacks and Queues 

## What is a Stack
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

##
1- Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
2-Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.<br>
3-Top - This is the top of the stack. <br>
4-Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.<br>
5-IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.<br>

## stack concept 

* `FILO ` <br>
First In Last Out

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

* `LIFO` <br>
Last In First Out 

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## What is a Queue
Common terminology for a queue is

1-Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue. <br>
2-Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.<br>
3-Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.<br>
4-Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.<br>
5-Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is 6-empty an exception will be raised.<br>
7-IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.<br>

## Queues follow these concepts:

`FIFO`
First In First Out

This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

`LILO`
Last In Last Out

This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.
