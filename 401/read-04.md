##  Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
 * Better program design and higher code quality
 * TDD reduces the time required for project development
 * With TDD you will get a reliable solution

## In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
 when you need call function before test 
 when you need call function after test 



##  What is one downside of Test Driven Development

 * slow process – If you begin TDD, you’ll get the sensation that you simply need an extended duration of your time for straightforward implementations. you would like to believe the interfaces, write the test code, and run the tests before you’ll finally start writing the code.

 

 

## What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.

A child of an ES6 class is another type definition which extends the parent with new properties and methods, which in turn can be instantiated at runtime. A child of a prototype is another object instance which delegates to the parent any properties that aren’t implemented on the child.


## why REST 

REST is Easy to Understand and Implement
Caching is Easier with REST
REST is Flexible




## Term 

1-functional programming : (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.

2-oriented programming (OOP) :  is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods).

3-Class: A class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). Super class That class is called a superclass, or parent class. and this keyword refere to the object which made from the calss.

 

4-Test-driven development :  is software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. In simple terms, test cases for each functionality are created and tested first and if the test fails then the new code is written in order to pass the test and making code simple and bug-free.

5-jest : is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, Inc. designed and built by Christoph Nakazawa with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Angular, Vue.js and Svelte.

6-Continuous integration CI :  is the practice of merging all developers’ working copies to a shared mainline several times a day.Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method, although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day – perhaps as many as tens of times per day.

7-REST : Representational state transfer is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful.

8- A data model  is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
