## How to Solve Programming Problems

 * A simple steps to solve prog. <br>
   1-Read the problem completely twice. <br>
   2-Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data. <br>
   3-Optimize the manual steps. <br>
   4-Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code. <br>
   5-Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code. <br>
   6-Optimize the real code.<br> 
## How to think like a programmer — lessons in problem solving

 Why is this important solve problem? <br>
 We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.

  how you solve problems ?<br>
  1-Try a solution. <br>
  2- If that doesn’t work, try another one. <br>
  3-If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out. <br>

 what should you do when you encounter a new problem?<br>
 1. Understand  <br>
 “If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it.” — Richard Feynman <br>
 2. Plan <br>
 To get a good plan, answer this question:

  “Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?”

  Sidenote: Programmers have a great tool to help them with this… Comments! <br>

 3. Divide <br>
  Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.  <br>
  Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve. <br>
  Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer (or are closer to that answer).

   After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.

   Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.

    Connecting all your “sub-solutions” will give you the solution to the original problem. Congratulations!

   This technique is a cornerstone of problem-solving. Remember it (read this step again, if you must).


 4. Stuck <br>
 The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

 In fact, here are three things to try when facing a whammy:

 1-Debug : Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).

 2-Reassess : Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

 3-Research : Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).

 Practice 

 Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

## 5 Whys
Getting to the Root of a Problem Quickly

 * How to Use the 5 Whys  <br>
   1-Assemble a Team <br>
   2-Define the Problem : write your statement on a whiteboard or sticky note, leaving enough space around it to add your answers to the repeated question, "Why?" <br>
   3-Ask the First "Why?" : Ask your team why the problem is occurring and search about solution 

   4- Ask "Why?" Four More Times : For each of the answers that you generated in Step 3, ask four further "whys" in succession. Each time, frame the question in response to the answer you've just recorded.

   5- Know When to Stop <br>
   6- Address the Root Cause(s) <br>
   7- Monitor Your Measures
