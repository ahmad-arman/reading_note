1- Describe “The Cloud” ?

"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. ... By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.


2- What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. ... Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure.


3- What is auto-scaling?

AWS Auto Scaling lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand. You can optimize availability, costs, or a balance of both. AWS Auto Scaling automatically creates all of the scaling policies and sets targets for you based on your preference.


4- What is bandwidth?

Bandwidth is a measure of how much information a network can transfer. The volume of data that can be transported varies, impacting how effectively a transmission medium, such as an Internet connection, operates.



5-How do cloud providers compute service costs?

The key cost factors which decide cloud hosting prices are storage, networking and computing. ... So, the vendor will consider the total virtual memory or RAM used in public clouds and divides this into costs for every rack unit of the hardware. Costs will include licensing fees depending on the OS you use.

##  Term

* Server Instances : A server instance is a collection of SQL Server databases which are run by a solitary SQL Server service or instance. The details of each server instance can be viewed on the service console which can be web-based or command-line based. 

* Containers : Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment. In this way, containers virtualize the operating system and run anywhere, from a private data center to the public cloud or even on a developer's personal laptop.

* Cloud Services :  refers to a wide range of services delivered on demand to companies and customers over the internet. These services are designed to provide easy, affordable access to applications and resources, without the need for internal infrastructure or hardware. From checking email to collaborating on documents, most employees use cloud services throughout the workday, whether they’re aware of it or not.

* Cloud Architecture : Cloud Architecture refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. Cloud architecture defines the components as well as the relationships between them.

* AWS : Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon providing on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis

EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku : Heroku and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, solutions (production configurations) is that they have comparable features and pricing. One big difference is that Heroku’s pricing takes exponential price jumps as one adds common additional features, e.g., auto-scaling, where-as AWS pricing is fairly linear. On the other hand, Heroku is generally simpler to get up and running as AWS has a fairly steep initial learning curve.

## AWS S3
Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface.
